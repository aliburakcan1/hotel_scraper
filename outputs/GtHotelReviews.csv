CgoI38SKsa2ovOpUEAE,Very disappointed with the way our booking was handled. Our flight was cancelled together with another 420 flights due a Strike happening in France and when got in touch with the Hotel they refused to understand the situation   charging an extra 149 euros fee to modify the reservation even though we were staying one night less. So we are meant to stay 4 nights but due to this emergency they asked us to pay 149 euros more to stay 3 nights not considering the situation which had less than 48 hours difference. Extremely disappointed with the lack of support and customer service as they would not even respond our email directly and they only dealing with a third part platform which I believe it was easier to say no. Poor customer service,Luiz Da Costa,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100563759501447536327?hl=en-US,1/5,,2 months ago on  Google,,,,
CgoI38SKsa2ovOpUEAE,"We had a great time at this lovely hotel. My friend and I came for 4 days and the hotel was everything we could've wanted and more. Not to mention being very close to the metro, the hotel had lovely rooms and the pool was a massive advantage. Service and check-in/out was very efficient, thank you especially to Claudia who was very helpful during our stay.

CgoI38SKsa2ovOpUEAE,"The room has very old furniture and a lot of problems that need to be fixed. The worst one was the shower, it is leaking a lot outside of it. Cleaning is only at surface and for rearranging  the bed. They did not replaced the tissue box, although they moved from were we left it. No view for our room, only to a building across the street.

CgoI38SKsa2ovOpUEAE,"The beds are extremely hard. I was supposed to stay for 6 nights. I complained after the first night and they did nothing. After I complained the second night they said they‚Äôd change my room. They didn‚Äôt change my room until the 3 night. It was the same so I just booked a completely new hotel. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money. It looks pretty but it‚Äôs cheap and you can find way better hotels for the same price. Also, their version of cleaning is using a dirty rag to wipe the sink then using the same rag to wipe other surfaces. The sink and the shower were disgusting. Unsure how they‚Äôre managing to get away with ranking this a 4 star hotel.",Stephanie Obadare,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117940102519111618702?hl=en-US,1/5,,10 months ago on  Google,,,,
CgoI38SKsa2ovOpUEAE,"First, I arrive to hotel on friday at 17:00 (quite normal hour where the hotel staff should be ready to receive clients) and I had to wait a long time to make the check-in, because I had two clients in front of me who were actually stupid, but the hotel only had one person to attend to. The second problem I find when I get to the room, I notice that there is gel for washing hands in the sink, but not in the shower. That is to say, if you want to soap yourself in the shower, you must move from the sink to the shower, barefoot, carrying the gel, you don't really know how. To make matters worse, there was no bar soap either, giving the impression that the hotel does not care about the comfort of its customers. Upon arrival, they also asked me what time I preferred to go down for breakfast, due to capacity issues, which I thought was a very good idea to ensure that the experience was safe and pleasant. It was not pleasant either, there were missing cutlery on the table where I sat down to have breakfast, so I don't know why try to ensure the capacity if you cannot even ensure that the customer has what they have to have for breakfast. In summary, for the high cost of the hotel the service is terrible, obvious things are missing and it is not worth it in the least.",Javier Menendez,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114146157846388610641?hl=en-US,1/5,,a year ago on  Google,4.0,3.0,1.0,

CgoI38SKsa2ovOpUEAE,"Arrived at hotel to find that my room reservation wasn't held despite a call and email to the hotel, and their ensuing confirmation. The staff were the epitome of unhelpful. I spent 1.5 hours with a newborn in the lobby after midnight trying to get them to sort out my room. Then the next day, I waited to ask a question to the hotel reception staff member for five minutes, during which she never acknowledged my presence. She was speaking to a new hire and telling her which uniforms to wear to work, all of which could have waited until after she attended to me as a hotel guest. The assumption that I couldn't understand what they were saying in Spanish was very sad but then even worse was feeling like I had disturbed them and wasn't a paying customer. As for the room, it's one of those tech-filled ones where nothing explains how anything works and so you suffer through that. Bed was okay, pillows not great, and my shower didn't appear to have been cleaned prior to my stay. All in all, their four stars are NOT deserved.

CgoI38SKsa2ovOpUEAE,"Very disappointed to say that this was a 4 star hotel. Not far from a bus stop to get the underground or to just go straight on the underground. Location not central but lovely and quiet. This was you can see from style a hotel which was current and well back in the day but as 4 star is concerned its let itself go a little.

No restaraunt on a night so onky expensive room service  from a local japanese takeaway tmwhich is a bit random and no visible easy places to walk to if you are alone.

CgoI38SKsa2ovOpUEAE,"(Translated by Google) This is possibly the worst hotel I have ever lived in (7 nights!)! In room 213 the blinds were broken, we discovered this at night when we went to bed. I had to go to reception and ask to be manually lowered. The furniture in the room is old, with obvious signs of wear. There were two chairs with frayed material on the seat. The next day we asked for another room (with a surcharge!). The furniture is just as old. Plumbing poor quality, cheap. The faucet in the bathroom and the shower head just flow. The pressure is small! The sink does not flush properly. Water just stands in the sink, it's not pleasant to wash. On the 3rd day at 12 noon, the pressure stopped altogether and I can't even take a shower! There is no kettle and glasses in the room, no iron either. Everything must be asked. Although these are basic things for living. You can choose a room with a view for a fee. The hotel is located near the road, the room is noisy, you can hear cars and motorcycles at night. The room is also noisy neighbors, our door constantly slammed when one of the neighbors or cleaners closed the door on the floor. It can drive you crazy.) The only thing is a wonderful employee at the reception! Very friendly, but I wish her to work in a more respectable place.

CgoI38SKsa2ovOpUEAE,"(Translated by Google) We stayed there for 7 days in early April. We can't really recommend this hotel either. The hotel is far away from the hustle and bustle, which we liked. However, without a taxi you are more likely to be in a fix here. The way to the city center is already very far. Unfortunately the air conditioning in the room didn't work. For this reason we had to inform the reception several times. There was also no toilet brush, we also had to request this by phone. The cleanliness left a lot to be desired. Glass surfaces were not cleaned. Neither at the hand basin, nor the window panes or the glass plate from the table. The soap dispenser was empty for days before it was replaced with a new bottle. Unfortunately, the cleaners do not understand English, which made communication difficult. And yes, the mattresses were rather uncomfortable. You could clearly see the feathers. Too bad. But the breakfast tasted very good. The selection was really good. (Original) Wir waren Anfang April dort f√ºr 7 Tage. Auch wir k√∂nnen dieses Hotel nicht wirklich weiterempfehlen. Das Hotel liegt weit abseits vom Trubel, was uns gut gefiel. Ohne Taxi ist man hier allerdings eher aufgeschmissen. Der Weg zur Innenstadt ist schon sehr weit. Leider funktionierte die Klimaanlage auf dem Zimmer nicht. Aus diesem Grund mussten wir mehrmals die Rezeption informieren. Auch eine Toilettenb√ºrste gab es nicht, diese mussten wir ebenfalls telefonisch anfordern. Die Sauberkeit lie√ü absolut zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig. Glasfl√§chen wurden nicht gereinigt. Weder am Handwaschbecken, noch die Fensterscheiben oder die Glasplatte vom Tisch. Der Seifenspender war tagelang leer, ehe dieser durch eine neue Flasche ausgetauscht wurde. Die Reinigungskr√§fte verstehen leider kein Englisch, was die Kommunikation erschwerte. Und ja, auch die Matratzen waren eher unbequem. Die Federn merkte man deutlich. Schade.

CgoI7vzhpMe-mZA7EAE,"Nice hotel. Room is brilliant with modern features such as electric blinds, Bluetooth in bed and bath room. Outside seating area on floor 1 is more chill than the roof top which can get quite busy. The cleaning staff in the outside area are very polite and always keep it clean. The pool on the roof was quite small at busy times and give it a miss most of the time. Beach is a stones throw away and can be accessed out the back on floor 1 which is a bit quicker than going out the front. Lifts could do with being linked together to make them quicker.

It is about 20 mins walk to the nearest Metro, and then at least about 30 mins on the metro to where a lot of the sights are. Taxis are also a bit awkward because it is far out so you can‚Äôt simply flag a taxi down. I just wanted to stay on the beach and swim, so for me, this hotel was perfect as I had no intention of sightseeing in Barcelona. Also, the lowest the air conditioning can go is 21 degrees.

Don't be shocked by on and off sudden loud water pipe sound in the bathroom. Walk 20 mins and there is the metro. The reception experience is different with different personnels. Food/Rooftop: Delicious fresh breakfast. Food is fresh and well-presented! The view at the rooftop is amazing, you could watch the gorgeous sunset. At the small infinity pool, the birds are flying near you. Cocktails are dilluted. Parking: Pay 18 eu for a good parking garage. üëéStaffs could be sharp on guests who are not behaving in the public. Had seen Slavic speaking couple wasting a lot of food at the breakfast buffet and showing too much unpleasant 'public affection' on the dining table at the corner.

CgoI7vzhpMe-mZA7EAE,"I stayed for a week at this hotel. Overall I had a good stay. The rooms are cleaned very well each day. The beds are comfortable and so are the pillows. The shower has good water pressure  and the wifi is fast enough. The food in the restaraunt is very good as well. They managed to find a good chef. A few things I didn't like. The AC cannot be lowered past 21 degrees celcius. It doesn't matter how many times you ask. I have travelled the world and this is the first time I have ever come across this. I found it pretty annoying tbh. They are obviously trying to save money but I probably wouldn't stay there again because of this. There is no room service after 11pm and the bar is closed for the night anywhere between 11.30pm and 12. Also the windows of the room were filthy. They were never washed after the build. There is a nice view there but this took away from it. They are only open two weeks but if you are charging over ‚Ç¨200 a night for a room the least you can do is to clean the windows.

CgoI7vzhpMe-mZA7EAE,"The hotel's lovely. Clean, spacious, well managed. It's by the beach, close-ish to Metro for getting into Barcelona and has restaurants and places to drink right on the doorstep with good shopping a 10 minute walk away. There are no bars specifically. Not like bars in Barcelona but you can easily get beers, wine, cocktails etc in multiple places all along the beach. Staff are very good, They are polite, efficient and helpful. Rooms are on the small size but for families, there are interconnecting rooms and a sliding door can be opened to join two rooms together. Great option for families. Bathrooms have glass walls so you can look in from the room so if you are happy looking at people showering and sitting on the toilet, this will not bother you. There is a blind that can be lowered but it is perforated meaning you can still see through into bathroom if the lights are on inside the bathroom. Only way to avoid being watched is to do your business in the dark or kick people out of the room. MAIN ISSUE....if you stay during summer months and over the weekend, you'll have to endure very loud music until 1am which comes from a live music venue, right outside the hotel. Apparently it's every weekend over the summer, so don't expect a peaceful weekend unless you have earplugs or can sleep through such things. Pool at top of hotel is lovely amd offers great views but is too small to accommodate a full-ish hotel which gets worse at weekends. It's fine if it is quiet but 8 adults in the pool will make it seem crowded. The pool bar is a nice touch and serves drinks and food which always looked good when it came out. Music is played around the pool and seating areas making it difficult to chill if you're not into music everywhere.. It's not loud, just too loud to relax. I enjoy reading or snoozing in the heat and the music spoils that. It would be nice to see the hotel utilise the open, outside area downstairs to build a bigger pool. Upstairs could be more for adults and a larger downstairs pool would be really good for families and kids. It really is a lovely hotel but I took off one star for the bathroom issue which is really mean but that kind of thing bugs me. I like my privacy. And one star for the loud music at weekends. That really does need addressing. Location is spot on if you don't need to get into Barcelona. If you do, and it's July / August, it can be a hot and sweaty experience getting to and from the metro. It not far really, but the heat makes a big difference. I would certainly stay again Monday to Friday but I'd check out Friday.... One note. I did a Google Maps street view walk through before staying and Street View makes the area look a lot more drab than it really is. It is a much nicer area than street view makes it look.",David Tudor,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109455849754607697721?hl=en-US,3/5,,3 months ago on  Google,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Response from the owner 4 months ago Dear Mr. Tudor, thank you very much for the full review.

Beim Einchecken hat uns Albert nicht wirklich herzlich empfangen wir mussten alles selbst erfragen. Die Kommunikation war kalt. Wenn man man eine Frage an die Rezeption stellte, hat sich das auch nur die Frage beschr√§nkt und das war es dann auch wieder. Vielleicht lag es aber auch daran, dass das Personal sehr jung ist und wir Kinder dabei hatten und wir immer wieder das Gef√ºhl hatten, dass diese nicht erw√ºnscht sind. Ein gro√ües Lob an die Damen vom Zimmerservice. Diese waren nett, ebenso die anscheinend leitende Chefin der Putzkr√§fte. Diese war auch sehr nett und hat Smalltalk mit uns im Fahrstuhl gemacht. Die Lage ist i.O. Es ist nicht viel los im Oktober. Wahrscheinlich wird die Gegend ausgebaut, was die Gegend attraktiver machen k√∂nnte. Vielleicht w√ºrden wir wiederkommen.

The first one was a good experience, that's why we wanted to come a second time. However, we fell into a room where the customers next door thought they were alone: ‚Äã‚Äãloud music until 2am. After asking the front desk to do a few things, the front desk just knocked on the person's door and phoned the room phone, actions that made absolutely no difference. The music was so loud that other patrons could hear it in the hallways. However, at no time were we offered to change rooms when they were absolutely impossible for us to sleep. The day after 7am the loud music starts again as well as the telephone conversations on the loudspeaker. We heard everything as if this person was in our room. So I go back to the reception to ask for a manager who of course was not there. So I explain that I want a full refund for my weekend (2 nights) for ‚Ç¨600, in the end we were changed rooms. No professional gesture was made to us regarding the paid night or we could not sleep and nothing was done. At the end of my weekend I am asked in addition to that to pay 36 euros more.

However, I believe for the price it is very difficult to find anything better.

Service was excellent, managed to check in early and staff were friendly and helpful throughout visit. Good location at the edge of the Gothic Quarter, but the road running to the north of the hotel is a busy street at night so very loud. Single glaze windows dont help the noise.

Service: Asked for double bed (not twin) not only not get it but also not respons on the request (via mail). At arrival had to take care of luggage myself. No help, no trolley nothing, find room yourself. Later saw someone else helped so guess it's if your lucky. Cleaning left dirty cleaning cloth on desk with changed pillow cover.

CgsI0ZuI8IaE4b-uARAB,"Big room, big bathroom, doors that open onto the city (we had a corner room) which was lovely. Its not that loud, and when the doors are close soundproofing is good. Decent black out curtains! Excellent location at the bottom of La Ramblas - can walk the whole area flat with ease. Few issues that were quite annoying: 1. No kettle, cups or coffee or tea in the room and none in reception! We were also only given water on the first day. Even when we asked, we were told that we had to go and get coffee at the bakery nearby and Spanish stores opening hours are all over the place. No tea at night. Very disappointed in that. 2. Our room was clearly a twin room, with a small double bed in the middle. I couldn't reach my light switch from my bed (and I'm 6ft3). I would recommend asking for 2 single beds and pushing them together. 3. Aircon was non-functional. Basically a weak fan. No matter how cold I turned the temperature, even on cold, nothing. Too loud outside to leave the doors open. 4. No smart TV. Get with it Hotels in Spain! No one watches TV. Atleast supply an HDMI. 5. Only allowed to connect 4 devices to WiFi. 6. Bathroom amenities (shower gel and soap) were the worst we've had in Spain. Would I stay there again? Not without coffee and tea and better bed set up and a guarantee that the aircon works. People were lovely and friendly and so so helpful. Hotel has so much potential.

Even on checking out they are reluctant to help with any request and barely say hello/goodbye (it wasn‚Äôt a language barrier either). Also the photography on the website of the rooms is amazing but not a true representation of the room, they‚Äôre small and at ‚Ç¨200 a night you‚Äôd expect something a bit bigger. The toilet didn‚Äôt work properly and there was a leak from the shower, we booked a room with a bath jacuzzi and it just wasn‚Äôt worth the money in the end. As for the swimming pool I echo the other reviews not enough beds and people hovering when you get up to go for a drink or to the restroom and almost fighting over sun beds. There isn‚Äôt pool staff around all the time either. Although they‚Äôre friendlier upstairs than at reception.

The hotel also has the worst sound insulation of any hotel I have ever been in, in 30 years of travel.  You can hear EVERYTHING in the room next door.  The TV, talking, bathroom sounds, everything.  One night there was a couple talking, until 3am.  You could hear every word.  Impossible to sleep.  The same night on the other side there was someone vomiting, it was as if they were in my room.

Thank you for your review. Regarding your painful affirmation, we wanted to check and offer you the following data on the hotel staff. The excellent and well matched current team is made up of: 42% Europeans, 6 different nationalities. 28% African, 6 different nationalities, 23% from the American continent, 8 different nationalities. 6% Asian, 4 different nationalities. 1% from Oceania. 62% women and 38 men. We are a young team, with great multicultural value which enriches us in a superlative way and its affirmation is not in any case in our day to day, much less in the attention to our clients. Without a doubt, we can make errors of interpretation, as was the case (for which we kindly explain the reasons and apologize again), and for these possible operational errors we are more than willing to be valued, although our values ‚Äã‚Äãmust be left out of any doubt. We are sorry that this error leads to a statement like yours and above all that this leads to a bad experience for you, although one of our obligations is to have control of assistance for your own well-being.

CgsI7o-xsb3izM6CARAB,"Listen to the reviews, DO NOT stay here! We have a whole list of things that were uncomfortable, unpleasant and terrible. I usually take reviews on the chin as I know people love a good moan but seriously this hotel is a 3 or 2 star at best. The poor reception staff had to deal with daily complaints. Firstly there is NO access to any drinking water. You have to buy water bottles from reception that are ¬£3 each for a small bottle. I don't know if this is even legal, but when you're spending hundreds of pounds a night the LEAST you can expect is drinking water. They provide glasses in the room with no signs that say the water is bad to drink and full of clorine, the staff advised us NOT to drink from the taps. Our bathroom tap didn't even go cold and was a mix of warm and cold water so very unsafe for drinking. There are ice machines on each floor... God knows what water they use to make this ice. Most are broken anyway. Qu√© to get into the hotel was 50+ mins as only two staff on door. Room was a superior double yet mini fridge is more like a room temp box. Scuffs everywhere, mouldy wood by shower and toilet was disabled so lots of equipment everywhere. Staff are overworked and probably underpaid, they always seem rushed off their feet. Floor stank of weed and there was spit in the lift. Pool is very shallow and doesn't accommodate all customers. Key didn't work at check in, had to come back in lift twice to get this fixed. No discount or money knocked off even after showing pictures of the room. Absolutely never visiting here again they don't care about customers or staff. Just making money.",Thea Helena,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110069954783337595295?hl=en-US,1/5,,3 months ago on  Google,1.0,2.0,5.0,

CgsI7o-xsb3izM6CARAB,"It has great facilities, clean rooms and amazing rooftop views... however the service we received, really let us down. The first problem we noticed is that there isn‚Äôt enough loungers by the pool, when the hotel is at capacity. We tried to enjoy the pool on the day we arrived but no space. Second to that, the pool was very dirty with bits of plastic and paper. bear in mind it‚Äôs not a cheap hotel >‚Ç¨200 per night. Well my girlfriend, was asked very rudely by a member of staff called Jordi who checks the pool area, if she stays there and could he see her key. It wasn‚Äôt the question but the manner in which he asked it. it‚Äôs sad because the manager Xavi and the reception staff are very nice and helpful but the staff from the restaurant and pool are useless. Lots of standing around chatting to each other and not enough service. The food menu is also bad and overpriced. I tried to get a coffee at 10am and the bar was soo busy and 1 person working I just gave up. For a hotel chain of this level it‚Äôs very sad to see the staff letting the place down. They definitely need to hire some professional hotel staff. When I complained about the rudeness of the guy, Xavi turned around and said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a language barrier and they do this with everyone.‚Äù Dayana my girlfriend is fluent in Spanish and mine is pretty good having lived here for 2 years, so my question to you Xavi, is what language barrier? This is a very insensitive comment considering, wouldn‚Äôt you say so? Sorry Xavi and SB team, not good enough - it‚Äôs your job to make your clients feel welcome and at home, no matter what language they speak. Unfortunately SB Glow failed at both, we visit Barcelona for Affiliate World every year and we would never stay again, nor would I recommend them to anyone else.

The sink is literally in the room! The toilet is just 1,5m from the bed behind a glass door you can't close properly. If you're traveling with a partner and you're into seeing, listening and smelling each other on the toilet it's your place to be.

CgsI7o-xsb3izM6CARAB,"The pool bar really sells the space with a completely relaxed vibe, so modern design, and I wish I booked more days just to stay around the pool a bit longer. The Instagram aesthetic around this space is so amazing. The rooftop bar snack menu and the nachos are outstanding! really amazing food. The bar is open late which is a bonus to go back after having dinner in town for a nightcap and look at the night skyline views. I would recommend the sangria and the pineapple juice if you go. If the pool wasn't in the equation I would question why it is a 4-star hotel, there are some elements that need looking at. The maid staff took 40 euros from our room when they cleaned our room, The bar staff, in the drinks menu, has all cocktails listed that they can do however when asked for them to do a mojito (which was on the list) they said we don't do cocktails here. As for the room, the walls are very thin so we couldn't get a decent night's sleep at all, we could hear next doors shower on/pipes all night. The air condition wasn't working, when we asked in the reception if it goes lower than 24 degree (which was the weather outside) they told us no. The coffee machine didn't work. The breakfast is overrated, walk ten minutes into the center you'll find a better breakfast there. The pool is not deep enough to swim in it, it isn't heated either and it doesn't open till 9 am. I think the hotel would be wise to open at 8:30 or 8 am as there was a queue in the hall to get to the pool at 8:20. The rooftop bar doesn't open until 11 am which is a shame as I think some customers would love a morning coffee or tea by the pool for the luxury element and price you're paying for the stay. Again if there was no rooftop bar or pool I would be extremely disappointed.",Helen Gallagher,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116859651322327711606?hl=en-US,3/5,,6 months ago on  Google,3.0,4.0,3.0,

The same applies to the girl from Argentina up on the roof restaurant. Room: Our minibar did not work on arrival and remained warm until we left although we informed reception daily. Rooms are kept clean. Some routines differ from day to day like supplying soap, towels, coffee etc. Upon check out we were not welcomed back or even thanked for visiting.

On the other side, the personal didn‚Äôt explain to us from that beginning that there was no mini bar, even water in the room and when you ask the reception to bring you some they ask you to come downstairs Anyway!

CgsI7o-xsb3izM6CARAB,"The hotel in general was good. The staff were friendly, the room was spacious and the locations worked well with the local transportation systems. One strange thing about the hotel was the fact that the bathroom and room is separated by a poorly frosted piece of glass which can feel like you don‚Äôt get enough privacy. This is clearly indicated by the pictures on the website, so this is perhaps more my fault, but nonetheless If you‚Äôre more than one person I can‚Äôt imagine you would feel completely private using the bathroom as such. The pool on the roof is simple for dipping in, it‚Äôs not a swimming pool and it does get very crowded however the atmosphere on the roof is nice and there is  great view out over Barcelona.",Maximilian Hvesser-Lewis,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108092609793080361967?hl=en-US,4/5,,2 years ago on  Google,,,,Response from the owner 2 years ago Thank you so much Maximiliam for your comments and review.

The Hotel restaurants and the room Service were CLOSED, due to the vacation season, and opened up again on Sep.1.

Hotel staff were helpful and printed our plane tickets ready for the morning of our departure and kept our bags after we checked out so we could explore easier. We also borrowed an umbrella for the day. The view from the top of the hotel was brilliant and it has a nice bar on the rooftop. The only downside is the lack of privacy of the bathroom as there is no solid door, which can be awkward when going to the toilet, but we just went to the foyer if needed!

CgsI7semh7nNrZKlARAB,They did let us check in early because my son had booked it and he has some sort of status.   He also booked it with his credit card as he intended it as a gift for us however they would not accept it on checkout and I had to pay.  The room phone didn't work so we couldn't call down for a porter the next day.  So we hauled our luggage down ourselves.  I'm 81 yo so that wasn't fun but we managed and hooked up with our ride to the port on time.  The location is OK but more business oriented.

I don‚Äôt know. But I didn‚Äôt contact them to change immediately, so not entirely their fault. The premium wifi is ok, 50MB is enough for basically everything in a hotel, but it is not configured really well with FaceTime, your FaceTime experience will be really bad.

CgsIlfeR45ngz6HSARAB,"Not recommended! I was only going to rank this hotel one star, but the staff on duty earned one more star for this hotel by offering two bottles of water for free at the last minute. Had no choice but to sign a waiver, when checking in, that if lost of valuables, the hotel has no reliability. I am still confused, is Barcelona not safe enough for tourists, in particular in a hotel? Having booked four nights, only the first day had free bottled water, which seems to suggest that you should book one day at a time rather than four days at once. Imagine coming back to your hotel after a long day of sightseeing and having no water to drink. Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

CgsIlfeR45ngz6HSARAB,"We spent a week here on vacation exploring Barcelona. It was a perfect central location, near several great restaurants for the particularly tiring days, and Ari was unbelievably kind, welcoming, and professional our entire stay. When we arrived early, our room wasn't ready but Ari welcomed us with a map showing us the nearby area and providing some great recommendations until we could check in. Any time Ari saw us come or go she would make sure we were having a good time. We left Barcelona exhausted, stuffed, and extremely happy with the memories and incredible food. Ari left us a sweet farewell note that was the cherry on top. Our room was comfortable and had a small fridge and plenty of storage for our luggage and clothing. There was a laundry service that we didn't utilize but wish we had! No breakfast thanks to covid but again, plenty of food nearby. Tables downstairs with iPads available to use and bottled drinks and snacks available for purchase. We did have a problem with our key cards not working randomly but that was fixed easily and quickly. These are just the amenities we used but I'm sure there's more! We had a great time and will be back to stay here on our next Barcelona trip.

CgsIlfeR45ngz6HSARAB,"We stayed there for two night in July, 2021 in Superior Room and payed 143,19 ‚Ç¨. PROS: -huge room, huge bed -hip neighbourhood -can walk to Park Guel -friendly staff -cute roof top CONS: -no breakfast during covid -poor sound insulation: you hear everything from the room next door as well as the traffic (even on 6th floor), slept with ear plugs -the hotel has parking but it was full, so we parked in a nearby garage that was 24 euros for a day. The hotel charges 20 euros per day for parking The lobby is great and has a very stylish feel, look and smell. But when you get to your floor/rooms you get the feeling a new owner bought some old hotel, gave it a new cool name, logo and lobby and only repainted the old hotel rooms. The carpet in the hallway is old and messy. Rooms are photogenic and the view is nice.

CgsIlfeR45ngz6HSARAB,"The friendly, warm and youthful reception staff is definitely the highlight of the hotel. Were I rating the hotel based on the staff alone, it‚Äôd be easily 5 stars. What detracted from my stay is the fact that the hotel rooms desperately needs refurbishing. From the over-used bathtub to the faux marble bathroom sinks to the anti-theft clothes hangers (really?) - the hotel screams early 2000 amenities that have not been updated for a modern day hotel. It is - acceptable - but, definitely *not* comfortable. The four star accreditation of the hotel is also misleading, because it doesn‚Äôt feel like a true 4 star experience. Let me end with more positives: the reception lounge, the loose leaf teas and the cake are all top notch. It is far more comfortable to hang out by reception than it is to be inside one‚Äôs room. The location of the hotel is also great and close to the hip and artistic neighborhood of Gr√†cia. And I should echo what I said earlier: the hotel staff elevates the stay tremendously.

Drawback was that only that one bottle of water was provided complimentary for entire stay of four days, would have been good if one bottle was provided each day. Breakfast provided had a decent spread of dishes with a local touch. Euro 10 worth of free calling from the room on the landline was really useful for calling home, thanks for that.

Bathroom is very shabby and does not look clean. Breakfast: amazing bread but terrible terrible coffee... and rather small selection compared to other hotels. Location is food. Walking distance to major attractions and metro stop. Update: 3rd and last day at hotel. Still using my data - luckily EU citizen. Hair dryer is heavy noisy and not effective. Breakfast with more people at the same time creates replenishment issues. One poor guy running around is not enough.
